To create a package:
    - make a package directory
    - if your package has sub-packages; create sub-directories accordingly
    - add *.java files to it
    - make sure all *.java files begins with 'package <package-name>';

To use a package
    - import packge by qualifying path


Let's continue with creating library methods
Also called packages in java

    - create min() method that
        -- accepts any number of arguments
        -- returns the smallest element
        

Let's create this package structure:

jtc
 - Math.java
 - Str.java

Q. Check if the string is palindrome

    Get a word/string from user                                         
    print "Is palindrome" if the word is palindromic
    print "Is not palindrome" otherwise
    
    Str.java (isPalindrome) method 
    import jtc.Str;
