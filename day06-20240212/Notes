            -----------------
            It is a special method to initialize an object
            It is executed when we use 'new' keyword
            It has the same name as the class
            It makes the object setup easier
            It also takes access modifiers

            Wallet 
                - amount (integer)
                - username (String)
                - addAmount()
                - deductAmount()
            
            Each class has many fields(eg. amount, username) and behaviours(eg. addAmount, deductAmount)
            Fields are nouns; behaviours are verbs
            
            
            Animal(String name, int age) {
                        
            }
            
            // each behaviour of object is defined in separate
            // method
            
            Animal(parameter-list) {
                // constructor
            }
            
            Animal dog = new Animal("name", age);
            dog.name = 
            dog.age = 
            Animal cat = new Animal("cat",12);
            dog & cat exist in memory 
            
        
            Make sure the wallet has enough amount
            when we deduct some money from it
            
            Tomorrow, we will look into:
                - Overloading of methods
                - Overloading of constructors
            
            Please be patient with the learning curve;
            it will get easier as you practice.
            
            Any class will provide these methods by default:
                - hashCode()
                - toString()
            Any class provides a default constructor if we
            do not provide any.

            TIPS:
             - use PascalCase for class name
             - use camelCase for fields and methods
             - use nouns to describe field variables
             - use verb-noun combination to describe method name
